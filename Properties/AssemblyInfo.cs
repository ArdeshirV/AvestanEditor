[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Spring Avestan Editor is an Avestan text editor. Avestan Editor is able to convert text to image that is more useful in web when you want to use Avestan words in web without an Avestan font. Avesta or Vesta means the truth and also Avestan is an ancient Iranian language that was very close to sanskrit but today we know it's older. Avesta is also an ancient Iranian poetic holy book that was written in Avestan language between 3700-1500 years ago in different years by Zarathushtra(Zoroaster) and his followers until Sasanian dynasty. It seems about 1600-2000 years ago Avestan language was not alive anymore so Iranian people created avestan alphabet to keep this ancient language alive because with this new alphabet we can read and write words without any problem. This alphabet system is also useful yet with other languages and specially Iranian languages or when you want to study or write Avesta. This version of Avestan Editor is free for everyone who love and praise Iranian wonderful civilization!")]
